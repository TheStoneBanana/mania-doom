# DOOM in Sonic Mania

*DOOM in Sonic Mania* is a mod for the 2017 game Sonic Mania that lets you play DOOM. 

The mod is based on the [Chocolate DOOM](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) source port, with elements referenced and lifted from [Crispy DOOM](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) for aspects of the widescreen implementation.

This source is being presented as-is and I don't intend on continuing to work on it.

## Obligatory Apology

This code is definitely a mess, sorry! Towards the end a lot was done just to get things working rather than to be clean or elegant, so there's portions that are super super hacky and lots of variables are strangely named. Enjoy that I guess :P
